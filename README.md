# hourly-calendar
A calendar application that stores events hourly.


## Description

This is a daily planner that provides a color-coordinated representation of the user's current day to easily identify which scheduled events have passed, are currently occuring, or have yet to occur. 



Some of the main components implemented for the success of the app were Web API concepts like event listeners, time intervals, and storing local storage objects; the use of Bootstrap components to style the app directly from the index.html; jQuery in the script.js to simplify the manipulation of the DOM,; googlefonts to customize the fonts in style.css; FontAwesome in the script.js to access a collection of icons and symbols and select one for the save button; and moment.js JavaScript library to format the live date and time displayed in the header of the app. 

## Installation

## Usage

To schedule events in the calendar, input text into the color-coordinated text boxes, then click the save icon adjacent to the text box. This ensures that the text does not dissapear upon refreshing the page. The text input should be stored in localStorage of the browser. The saved text will be displayed in its respective color relative to the current time displayed in the header, above the scheduled events. Events that have passed are displayed as orange text boxes, current events display as yellow text boxes, and future events display as green text boxes.
